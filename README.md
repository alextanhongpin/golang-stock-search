# Go-kit Stock Search

A simple app made with go-kit while learning microservices with golang.

:)

The folders are structured this way:
- config (contains the app config)
- stocksvc (contains the services for getting the stock data)
- client (contains the logic for rendering the HTML templates)

###TODO

- Add CRUD for storing favourite stocks
- Add persistent database
- Add sources from WIKI, news reader...
- Add bots?
- Improve the UI/UX
